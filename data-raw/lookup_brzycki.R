# Formula is 1rm = weight * 36 / (37 - r).

# This gives you the 10 RPE row.

# Plan to extend this to RPE scales is:  a 1 rep @ 9 = 2 @ 10.  1 rep @ 8 = 2 @ 9 = 3 @ 10, etc.  The you can interpolate to find 9.5, 8.5, etc.  I think this is a solid plan actually.

# I'll probably cap the table at something like 20 reps.  The actual suggestion may have been to go lower.
